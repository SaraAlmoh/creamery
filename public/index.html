    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
        Scoops n' Smiles is one of the world's largest chain of ice cream specialty 
        shops, providing guests with a wide array of ice cream flavors and 
        delicious treats at more than 500 retail shops in more than 12 
        countries around the world. The brand was founded by two ice cream 
        enthusiasts whose passion for ice cream led to the creation of many
        iconic ice cream flavors including Pralines 'n Cream, Jamoca Almond
        Fudge and Very Berry Strawberry. Today, Scoops n' Smiles has more 
        than 1,300 ice creams in its flavor library, and also offers custom
        ice cream cakes, frozen beverages and the Polar Pizza Ice Cream Treat.
        Its franchised ice cream shops serve as places where people can 
        connect and create special memories while they explore a 
        wide array of flavors, including a new Flavor of the Month 
        every month. Headquartered in Canton, Mass., Scoops n' Smiles
        is part of the Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: DNKN) family 
        of companies.
